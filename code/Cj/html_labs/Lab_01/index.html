      <p>Naruto Uzumaki is a fictional animated character created by Masashi Kishimoto. 
      <br>He appears as the main character of the Manga / Anime series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto">Naruto</a>. 
      <br> Naruto is a young ninja from a fictional village called "The hidden leaf village".</p>
      <p>He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. 
      <br>After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage.
      <br> In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, 
      <br> becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf. He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, 
      <br>leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage</p>
