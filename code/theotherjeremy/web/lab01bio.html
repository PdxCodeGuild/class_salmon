     <p>Albert Hofmann was a Swiss chemist known best for being the first known person to synthesize, ingest, and learn of the psychedelic effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Hofmann was also the first person to isolate, synthesize, and name the principal psychedelic mushroom compounds psilocybin and psilocin. He authored more than 100 scientific articles and numerous books, including LSD: Mein Sorgenkind (LSD: My Problem Child). In 2007, he shared first place with Tim Berners-Lee in a list of the 100 greatest living geniuses, published by The Daily Telegraph newspaper.</p>

     <p>Albert Hofmann first synthesized LSD in 1943.  It was while working in his lab one night that he accidentally ingested a tiny amount of the substance. He felt intense changes in his perception, and asked his research assistant to escort him home.  They rode their bikes to Albert's home, where a doctor came and called on him.  The doctor noticed his enlarged pupils, but othwise couldn't find anything wrong with him.  The events of this night has since been coined "Bicycle Day," commemorating the events of the first acid trip. </p>

     <div><p>“By observing natural scientific discoveries through a perception deepened by meditation, we can develop a new awareness of reality. This awareness could become the bedrock of a spirituality that is not based on the dogmas of a given religion, but on insights into a higher and deeper meaning. I am referring to the ability to recognize, to read, and to understand the firsthand revelations.”
