          <li>November 10th, 1923 - Born in Ōdate-shi, Akita Prefecture, Japan</li>

        <p>Hachikō was born on November 10th, 1923, at a farm in 
          the Akita Prefecture. At the age of one, his owner 
          Hidesaburō Ueno brought him to Shibuya, Tokyo, as his pet. 
          Hachiko would wait for Hidesaburō at Shibuya Station every day. 
          This continued until Hidesaburō's death in 1925 from a cerebral hemorrhage. 
          Until he died in 1935, Hachikō would wait at Shibuya Station every day 
          to await his owner's return.</p>
        <p>Today Hachikō is remembered in Japanese culture as an example of loyalty and fidelity. 
          He continues to be remembered worldwide through popular culture, statues, movies, books, 
          and apperances in various media.</p>
