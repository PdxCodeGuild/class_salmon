# Study Drills
# 1) Go through the program and write a comment above each line explaining it
# 2) How many strings contain a string? 4
# 3) line 4 conatins an integer, line 25 contains a boolean
# 4) line 36 makes a longer string because the variables are unpacked as strings,
# then concatenated together.
