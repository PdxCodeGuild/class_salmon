# Study Drills
# 1.Find out if you were right about what the # character does and make sure you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).

# 3.Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
# 4.Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character by its name. Did you find more mistake? Fix them
