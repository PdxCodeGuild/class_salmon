# Hello World!
# Hello Again
# I like typing this.
# This is fun.
# Yay! Printing.
# I'd much rather you 'not'.
# I "said" do not touch this.

# Study Drills
# For this exercise, try these things:
# 1. Make your script print another line.
#print("I can always print another line.")
# 2. Make your script print only one of the lines.
print("Only print this line")
# 3. Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.
# Makes a line commented
