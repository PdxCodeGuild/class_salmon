Steps:

1. import random English word

2. translate to Arabic

3. give user meaning in English 

*ideally, give user meaning in English and AR, plus additional AR synonyms/similar, plus English transliteration; ideally ideally give sentence example

Issues:

Obviously, definitions aren't always perfect

Buttons in GUI aren't functional, except to move forward 

If English word not found in Arabic, word is simply transliterated into AR - 
For example, 'brooks' returned the name 'Brooks' (no other definitions), and was phonetically spelled out in AR بروكس

Several definitions for the English word comes out as only one possible AR word -
For example, 'casts' only returns 'يلقي' meaning 'he throws/casts'

If first line is description, description is listed as a definition - 
For example, 'firmware' printed 'Noun. 1. (computer science)'

Synonyms seem to be off, as well -
For example, one synonym of 'sums' was 'red ink' and 'peanuts' (which gets translated into AR literally - no room for nuance)

If a synonyms has no AR equivalent, prints EN word - 'adumbrate': 'adumbrate'

So far, only nouns and verbs have been produced - no adj., adv., etc.
