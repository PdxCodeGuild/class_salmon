# Lab 15: Quotes API
# For this lab we'll be using the Favqs Quotes API to first get a random quote, and then allow the user to find quotes by keyword. To accomplish this we'll be using the requests library.
import requests

# Version 1: Get a Random Quote
# The URL to get a random quote is https://favqs.com/api/qotd, send a request here, parse the JSON in the response into a python dictionary, and show the quote and the author.
random_response = requests.get('https://favqs.com/api/qotd/', headers= {'Accept': 'application/json'})
data = random_response.json()['quote']
qotd = data['body']
author = data['author']
print(f'\n"{qotd}"\n\n-{author}')


# Version 2: List Quotes by Keyword
# The Favqs Quote API also supports getting a list of quotes associated with a given keyword https://favqs.com/api/quotes?page=<page>&filter=<keyword>. Prompt the user for a keyword, list the quotes you get in response, and prompt the user to either show the next page or enter a new keyword. You can use string concatenation to build the URL.
