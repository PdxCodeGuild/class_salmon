The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing

1. The Law of Leadership
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 9
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The basic issue in marketing is creating a category you can be first in.
</div>
<div class="sectionHeading">
2. The Law of the Category
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 17
</div>
<div class="noteText">
This is counter to classic marketing thinking, which is brand oriented: How do I get people to prefer my brand? Forget the brand. Think categories. Prospects are on the defensive when it comes to brands. Everyone talks about why their brand is better. But prospects have an open mind when it comes to categories. Everyone is interested in what’s new. Few people are interested in what’s better.
</div>
<div class="sectionHeading">
15. The Law of Candor
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 76
</div>
<div class="noteText">
First and foremost, candor is very disarming. Every negative statement you make about yourself is instantly accepted as truth.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 76
</div>
<div class="noteText">
You have to prove a positive statement to the prospect’s satisfaction. No proof is needed for a negative statement.
</div>
<div class="sectionHeading">
16. The Law of Singularity
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 79
</div>
<div class="noteText">
What works in marketing is the same as what works in the military: the unexpected.
</div>
<div class="sectionHeading">
17. The Law of Unpredictability
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 84
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Equally as bad as extrapolating a trend is the common practice of assuming the future will be a replay of the present. When you assume that nothing will change, you are predicting the future just as surely as when you assume that something will change. Remember Peter’s Law: The unexpected always happens.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 85
</div>
<div class="noteText">
One way to cope with an unpredictable world is to build an enormous amount of flexibility into your organization. As change comes sweeping through your category, you have to be willing to change and change quickly if you are to survive in the long term.
</div>
<div class="sectionHeading">
18. The Law of Success

<div class="noteText">
Ego is the enemy of successful marketing. Objectivity is what’s needed.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 88
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Donald Trump and Robert Maxwell are two examples of people blinded by early success and untainted by humility. And when you’re blind, it is indeed hard to focus.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 89
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Actually, ego is helpful. It can be an effective driving force in building a business. What hurts is injecting your ego in the marketing process.
</div>
<div class="sectionHeading">
20. The Law of  Hype
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Page 94
</div>
<div class="noteText">
When IBM was successful, the company said very little. Now it throws a lot of press conferences. When things are going well, a company doesn’t need the hype. When you need the hype, it usually means you’re in trouble.

{"Book Title": "The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness", "Author": "Jorgenson, Eric", "0": "If you don\u2019t know yet what you should work on, the most important thing is to figure it out. You should not grind at a lot of hard work until you figure out what you should be working on.", "1": "Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.", "2": "Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.", "3": "Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.", "4": "Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.", "5": "The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed. They are creative expressions of continuous learners in free markets.", "6": "The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner.", "7": "It\u2019s much more important today to be able to become an expert in a brand- new field in nine to twelve months than to have studied the \u201cright\u201d thing a long time ago.", "8": "Basic arithmetic and numeracy are way more important in life than doing calculus. Similarly, being able to convey yourself simply using ordinary English words is far more important than being able to write poetry, having an extensive vocabulary, or speaking seven different foreign languages.", "9": "Knowing how to be persuasive when speaking is far more important than being an expert digital marketer or click optimizer. Foundations are key.", "10": "It\u2019s much better to be at 9/ 10 or 10/ 10 on foundations than to try and get super deep into things.", "11": "If someone can train other people how to do something, then they can replace you. If they can replace you, then they don\u2019t have to pay you a lot. You want to know how to do something other people don\u2019t know how to do at the time period when those skills are in demand.", "12": "Whenever you can in life, optimize for independence rather than pay. If you have independence and you\u2019re accountable on your output, as opposed to your input\u2014 that\u2019s the dream.", "13": "What you want in life is to be in control of your time. You want to get into a leveraged job where you control your own time and you\u2019re tracked on the outputs.", "14": "If you\u2019re going to live in a city for ten years, if you\u2019re going to be in a job for five years, if you\u2019re in a relationship for a decade, you should be spending one to two years deciding these things.", "15": "Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you\u2019re retired.", "16": "Art is creativity. Art is anything done for its own sake. What are the things that are done for their own sake, and there\u2019s nothing behind them? Loving somebody, creating something, playing. To me, creating businesses is play. I create businesses because it\u2019s fun, because I\u2019m into the product.", "17": "Your real r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is just a catalog of all your suffering.", "18": "Julius Caesar famously said, \u201cIf you want it done, then go. And if not, then send.\u201d What he meant was, if you want it done right, then you have to go yourself and do it. When you are the principal, then you are the owner\u2014 you care, and you will do a great job. When you are the agent and you are doing it on somebody else\u2019s behalf, you can do a bad job. You just don\u2019t care. You optimize for yourself rather than for the principal\u2019s assets.", "19": "It\u2019s worth reading a microeconomics textbook from start to finish.", "20": "But you want arithmetic, probability, and statistics. Those are extremely important. Crack open a basic math book, and make sure you are really good at multiplying, dividing, compounding, probability, and statistics.", "21": "If I\u2019m faced with a difficult choice, such as: Should I marry this person? Should I take this job? Should I buy this house? Should I move to this city? Should I go into business with this person? If you cannot decide, the answer is no.", "22": "When you choose something, you get locked in for a long time. Starting a business may take ten years. You start a relationship that will be five years or maybe more. You move to a city for ten to twenty years. These are very, very long- lived decisions. It\u2019s very, very important we only say yes when we are pretty certain. You\u2019re never going to be absolutely certain, but you\u2019re going to be very certain.", "23": "Simple heuristic: If you\u2019re evenly split on a difficult decision, take the path more painful in the short term.", "24": "What are the most efficient ways to build new mental models? Read a lot\u2014 just read.", "25": "Reading science, math, and philosophy one hour per day will likely put you at the upper echelon of human success within seven years.", "26": "When you\u2019re young, you have time. You have health, but you have no money. When you\u2019re middle- aged, you have money and you have health, but you have no time. When you\u2019re old, you have money and you have time, but you have no health. So the trifecta is trying to get all three at once.", "27": "All you should do is what you want to do. If you stop trying to figure out how to do things the way other people want you to do them, you get to listen to the little voice inside your head that wants to do things a certain way. Then, you get to be you.", "28": "If there\u2019s something you want to do later, do it now. There is no \u201clater.\u201d", "29": "Advice to my younger self: \u201cBe exactly who you are.\u201d Holding back means staying in bad relationships and bad jobs for years instead of minutes.", "30": "Courage isn\u2019t charging into a machine gun nest. Courage is not caring what other people think.", "31": "Value your time. It is all you have. It\u2019s more important than your money. It\u2019s more important than your friends. It is more important than anything. Your time is all you have. Do not waste your time.", "32": "As long as you\u2019re doing what you want, it\u2019s not a waste of your time. But if you\u2019re not spending your time doing what you want, and you\u2019re not earning, and you\u2019re not learning\u2014 what the heck are you doing?", "33": "People who live far below their means enjoy a freedom that people busy upgrading their lifestyles can\u2019t fathom.", "34": "A taste of freedom can make you unemployable.", "35": "The modern struggle: Lone individuals summoning inhuman willpower, fasting, meditating, and exercising\u2026 Up against armies of scientists and statisticians weaponizing abundant food, screens, and medicine into junk food, clickbait news, infinite porn, endless games, and addictive drugs.", "36": "All benefits in life come from compound interest, whether in money, relationships, love, health, activities, or habits. I only want to be around people I know I\u2019m going to be around for the rest of my life. I only want to work on things I know have long- term payout."}
