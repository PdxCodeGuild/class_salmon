- **Citizen Caucus** is an aggregate of information on the US Senate. It features profiles of senators, including their photo, contact information, and voting history on past bills. The data is taken from the [ProPublica API](https://www.propublica.org/) and [Sunlight API](https://sunlightfoundation.com/api/). It also has search with suggestions.

- **Tit4Tat** is, at its most basic concept, designed for people to exchange time for services rendered rather than money. In other words, a person (in my case a filmmaker) will post a project that they have in mind and is looking for help. By looking through other projects they can communicate to the other creator and then commit to each others idea if agreeable. User profiles include skills (type and level), interests, and equipment. By Remington Hendrickson [screenshot](Past%20Capstone%20Screenshots/tit4tat.jpg)
- **Hardcore Lives** keeps track of the local Hardcore shows and bands in Portland. The front page has an instragram embed, a carousel of local venues, and search. There's also a social media component, you can whether you're attending a show and upload flyers of upcoming shows. On the back-end, Beautiful Soup is used to scrape 8 different websites for shows, collecting their title, location, and date. By Michael.
- **Write 2 Learn** features tools to automatically provide feedback to students learning English. Users can make blog posts. One section lets them visualize the parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective) of their posts. Another section highlights any errors that they made. Users can also view charts of their error counts over time and the different counts of the parts of speech in their posts. There's also a page which shows the parts of speech in real time using NLTK. It uses several APIs including the Google Language API. By Ryan.
- **Chanterelle** allows users to write a Todo list with ordered events, represented as a directed acyclic graph. The main view uses [Cytoscape](http://js.cytoscape.org/) to visualize the nodes and edges of the graph. A "next up" list shows only the immediate todo items. Redundant edges are already removed (transitive reduction), as well as cycles. The back-end uses Django Rest Framework and the front-end is in React. By Emyli Poltorak.

- Time and task tracking based on the Pomodoro Technique, with a visualization of break and focus periods and timeline using [vis.js](http://visjs.org/).
- **Viewsic** connects to your Spotify account to show the artists, genres, and songs you play most often. It also shows the overall scores of your music by happiness, dancibility, and energy, and compares them to the average. By Matthew.
