# You graduated! So now what?

Congratulations! You've learned and accomplished a lot over the last twelve weeks, but you're not done yet. 
Getting your first job in tech will require you to put in effort every day, so you should still be showing up at the Code Guild every morning, even if no one is taking attendance. 
Between finishing and deploying your capstone, putting together application materials, doing research on companies, and networking, there's a ton to do. Let's get started!

You should be spending half your day continuing to code, and half your time working on getting a job. 
A good rule of thumb is to be at the Code Guild at 9:30am every day, just like during class. 
Spend your morning working on coding projects, and your afternoon working on job search tasks. 
This gives you the flexibility to go to networking events, interviews, etc in the afternoon.

The software development industry has a reputation for being able to work alone, but is in fact a 
highly collaberative industry and the old rule about "90% of anything is showing up" very much applies. 
Continuing to show up at the Code Guild gives you a focused work enviroment, easy access to support in your 
job search (and coding projects), and you will be the first to hear of any new opportunities from other students, 
grads, or Code Guild staff.

With that being said, there's a lot to do. Where does one get started?

## Day 1

First things first -- you need social profiles you can point people to, and a deployed capstone projects you can show off. Don't worry too much about these things being perfect at first. You'll continue to work on them as you go, but you absolutely need them in place now.

- Make sure your capstone builds without errors and is functional, even if it's not "complete" yet.
- Get a personal domain and build a portfolio web site with links to your projects.
- Update your LinkedIn profile. See the LinkedIn checklist for more details. Start adding your classmates, instructors, friends, contacts, etc.
- Google your own name and see what comes up.
- Organize your Github profile. Make sure it has your contact info and a picture. Star at least two respositories to highlight them for visitors. Aim to push changes to github at least once a day to keep your activity graph green.

## Day 2

Not only do you need to make sure you have your capstone and porfolio deployed, but it's time to start networking. This is the part that moves the slowest, so it's important to start as soon as your social presence, capstone, and portfolio site are up and active.

- Finish the MVP of your personal portfolio website and make sure it is live. [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is great for static websites like this.
- Deploy your capstone on the internet so you can show it off. Bonus points for a custom domain. A good service to use for this is [Python Anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/). Ask Chris for more help deploying your capstone.
- Check your LinkedIn "people you may know" and add any people you know.
- Start a speadsheet of leads, contacts, companies you've interacted with. [Example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n7fHEcq11OV6m7VlRXPJopIcTlSd3rJrGh10D62u70o/edit#gid=1018827592)
- Brainstorm people in your contacts you can reach out to do informational interviews with (coworkers, classmates, friends)
- Check Meetup.com and Calagator for meetups and other tech events in town. Try to attend ones that target senior devs and avoid ones that target junior devs.

## Day 3

- Continue to work on deploying your capstone and portfolio.
- Check your LinkedIn "people you may know" and add any people you know.
- Reach out to three new contacts and ask for an informational interview.
- Create an MVP resume. You will continue to refine this as you go and you should tailor your resume to every company you apply to, but you need a generic resume completed for when prospective emoplyers ask. See the Resume Checklist for details.
- Create a generic cover letter. Again, you will tailor this to each prospective employer but you need a template.


## Day 4

- Finish deploying your capstone and portfolio.
- Check your LinkedIn "people you may know" and add any people you know.
- Reach out to three new contacts and ask for an informational interview.
- Finish your resume and cover letter if you have not already.
- Draft a template email for following up after informational interviews.

## Day 5

- Look back at your capstone proposal and identify the "nice to have" features that you didn't have time to implement in class.
- Identify one new framework/library/language/tool you would like to learn.
- Check your LinkedIn "people you may know" and add any people you know.
- Reach out to three new contacts and ask for an informational interview.
- Make sure you have RSVPed to a full schedule of meetups.

## Check your progress

One week after graduation, you should have the following:

- A deployed capstone
- A deployed personal portfolio website
- Complete Github and LinkedIn profiles
- Basic MVPs of your resume and cover letter
- A "thank you for talking today" email template
- A spreadsheet to track leads, contacts, and companies

You should also have done the following:

- Indentified one new development framework/concept/etc you would like to learn
- Brainstormed contacts you already know
- Sent invites to at least 50 people on LinkedIn
- RSVPed to at least one meetup or event every week. Aim for two!
- Asked 5-10 connections for informational interviews. These don't have to be people you personally know, new LinkedIn connections are fine. Don't be afraid to butter up people a little when asking! Everyone wants to be the admired expert and pontificate a little.

## Week 2

#### Coding projects

- Keep working on your capstone! Implement some of your "nice to have" features and make sure your project shows polish. Spend some time refining the styling and the user experience.
- Find some learning resources for the development concept you want to learn next. These can be articles, tutorials, videos, books, etc. It depends on your learning style.
- After you get the basics down, start a new project for your portfolio using what you've learned.

#### Networking
- Check your LinkedIn "people you may know" every day and add any people you know.
- Reach out to at least one contact a day for informational interviews or to ask questions.
- Refine your resume/cover letter/portfolio/Github/LinkedIn as needed.
- As you start going on informational interviews, be sure to follow up via email afterward to thank them for their time. Ask for introductions to other people to do informational interviews with.
- Attend meetups! Be sure to add the people you talk to on LinkedIn and ask them in person for their contact information and an informational interview.

#### Start researching companies and positions
- Look at past students on LinkedIn and see where they worked after graduating
- Start looking at job listings. [Portland Tech Jobs](http://portlandtech.org/) is a good guide to what companies are hiring for what positions in the Portland area.
- Check the Job Search checklist for other job boards.
- Research potential employers on Glassdoor.
- Find a way to make a connection at the companies you want to work for and ask them for informational interviews or what positions they have open. If you have a personal connection at the company, great! If not, look on LinkedIn for connections at the company or even people at the company with mutual connections and reach out. Do some research and see if the company organizes or sponsors any meetups or events. If they do, then go, participate, and reach out in person. Make sure to get contact info and follow up to talk with them or someone at the company! As your network grows, this process becomes easier and easier. This is why you should start networking as soon as possible after graduating. If you started networking during your first week after graduating, by now you will already be building up a network.

## Week 3

- Add your latest projects to your portfolio as you create them.
- Make sure you have started applying to jobs.
- Continue to attend meetups and events as often as you can. Add the people you meet on LinkedIn and follow up.
- Continue to go on informational interviews, and don't forget to track who you talk to and follow up with them afterwards.
- Have Code Guild staff review your resume.
- Do mock interviews with Code Guild staff.
- Follow up with contacts every 2-3 weeks.
