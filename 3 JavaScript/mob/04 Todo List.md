# Lab 4: Todo List

Let's make a simple todo-list which supports the following operations:

- add an item to the list
- remove an item from the list
- mark an item as completed

Removed items should disappear entirely. Completed items should appear at the bottom (or in a separate list) with a line through them.

## If Time Allows

Once you have your to-do list app complete, use the browser's [local storage](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-local-storage-with-javascript/) to save your todos and load them when you first load the page.
