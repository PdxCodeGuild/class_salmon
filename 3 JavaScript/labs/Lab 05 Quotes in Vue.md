# Lab 5: FavQs in Vue


Build a Vue application that allows a user to search for quotes on FavQs.

Requirements:
- Your app must use Vue to fetch data and interact with the results.
- Let the user enter a search term and select whether to search by keyword, author, or tag.
- Implement pagination buttons when the search returns more than 25 quotes.
- When the page first loads, show the user a set of completely random quotes.
- You must have at least one Vue component in your app.

Resources:
- [FavQs API](https://favqs.com/api)
- [Vue documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)
- [Using Axios to Consume APIs](https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/using-axios-to-consume-apis.html)
- [Axios documentation](https://github.com/axios/axios)

Hints:
- Read the API documentation!
- Remember to use your Vue app `data` as your single source of truth.
- You'll need to set the `Authorization` header for the FavQs API to work.
