# Lab 1-3: Pick 3

## Part A

Pick 3 Python labs and re-do them in JavaScript. You should first try to write them using JavaScript's `prompt` and `alert` in place of Python's `input` and `print`.

## Part B

Once you have that working, use `input` and `button` elements, with events. You can read the docs on [DOM Manipulation](../docs/11%20-%20DOM%20Manipulation.md) and [Events](../docs/12%20-%20Events.md). You can view a demo [here](https://codepen.io/flux2341/pen/rJpBXe?editors=1010). Please save these as separate files from your part A.
